    "Pudgy Party was my second title at Mythical Games. I joined mid-development and spent my early time ramping up on an unfamiliar codebase.",
    "I worked with Unity running as a headless distributed Linux server for multiplayer, and Beamable as a backend service layer.",
    "I took ownership of the Shop and Battle Pass, improving the experience with intuitive auto-scroll mechanics and building a reveal animation for new Battle Pass seasons.",
    "The shop had performance issues — I reduced load times by 50% by tracking down hidden UI elements that were performing unnecessary async work in the background.",
    "I also led a large-scale refactor of the shop, restructuring the data architecture to support reusable content scheduling for live ops while closing security vulnerabilities that let purchase limits and item costs be bypassed.",
    "A lot of my time went into bug fixing and stabilisation, particularly issues caused by the front and back end falling out of sync.",
    "I integrated animations built in Unity Animator into game features, hooking up logic-dependent sequences and the Battle Pass reveal flow.",
    "I was in the early stages of re-designing an existing system prior to the end of my time on this project."
