  "description": [
    "NFL Rivals was my first professional game project. I joined Mythical Games during pre-production and stayed with the title for over two years post-launch.",
    "I worked closely with UX designers and UI artists, translating Figma wireframes into polished features across Inventory, Marketplace, Trading, Crafting, Training, Tutorials, Quests, Achievements, and Prime Integration.",
    "The Inventory was a standout feature. It started as a single screen but became central to the game when I refactored it into reusable modules. The resulting framework was shared with two other studios.",
    "With thousands of collectable items, performance mattered. I implemented pooling and load reduction to keep it at 30fps on low-end devices, and built a Linked List Layout Rebuilder to handle nested dropdown filtering and minimise expensive layout recalculations.",
    "I authored flow through most of the games features using Playmaker FSMs.",
    "On the backend, I built and extended features, debug tools, and admin tools with Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Handlebars.",
    "I also built tween-based animations, extended the gameplay HUD, and iterated on editor tooling for marketing asset capture."
